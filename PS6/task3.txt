Research and analyze the POSIX alternatives for shared memory and semaphores.
Describe the differences between them and the System V mechanisms used in
the previous tasks, and highlight advantages and disadvantages of both.



Both have the same basic tools like semaphores, shared memory and message queues.


In System V Semaphores you can control how much the the Semaphore Value can be increased or decreased.
Whereas in POSIX you can increase/decrease it just by 1

In System V you create an array of semaphores, instead of just one. 
Because of this System V Semaphores are costlier than POSIX Sempahores

IN Posix everything has String name, while in System V it is just an integer.

POSIX is newer than System V. So maybe there are some portability problems. 

*POSIX is thread-safe
